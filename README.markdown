# Retreet: An easy way to share snippets of information internally

Essentially, this is a small-scale twitter clone, designed to allow people at [The Columbian](http://www.columbian.com) to communicate quick ideas / notes privately.

I've made the repo public because honostly, there's nothing new here - in fact parts of this came out of Michael Hartl's great tutorial on Rails, but I figured, if it helps anyone else out - why not?

## Quick Notes

- Basic, but it works. Lacks a little bit of polish, I intend to work on that soon.
- Styles are incomplete
- Not designed for use on an external network, I have no idea what kinds of security issues may be lurking in here.

## Yours - [Ramiro Jr. Franco](mailto:rjfranco@gmail.com)

# Retreet: An easy way to share snippets of information internally

Essentially, this is a small-scale twitter clone, designed to allow people at [The Columbian](http://www.columbian.com) to communicate quick ideas / notes privately.

I've made the repo public because honostly, there's nothing new here - in fact parts of this came out of Michael Hartl's great tutorial on Rails, but I figured, if it helps anyone else out - why not?

## Quick Notes

- Still very, very basic, and "unpolished"
- User Model is now working
- Micropost Model is partially complete
- Styles are very incomplete
- Not designed for use on an external network, I have no idea what kinds of security issues may be lurking in here.
